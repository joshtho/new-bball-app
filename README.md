# Who does he play for? NBA App

I used a database from balldontlie.io to make a web application that searches any NBA player's name (retired or current) and brings back a list of all players with that name and a drop down that contains a card with their full name, full team name, position and 2021-22 season stats if applicable. I implemented React-router-dom v6 to build a client-side-routing system, fetched and iterated data from an API while using the 'useState' hook, and used bootstrap CSS to style. 
## How to use

Fork and clone 
run npm install 
run npm start to run the app in development mode
